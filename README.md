### About the Project

-This project was built by Leonid Sorkin. 
-The goal of this project was to create a simple space shooter game. In order to do that I had to apply the knowledge of C#, Unity and object oriented programming. Some of the things I did during the project:
<ul>
  <li>Learned how object-oriented programming works in practice</li>
  <li>Learned how to apply C# knowledge(through previous little projects in the same course)</li>
  <li>Used coroutines to create reapeated fire mechanism</li>
  <li>Create scriptable objects that were responsible for enemy path and wave speed</li>
  <li>Apply C# knowledge to create different scripts and attach them to objects in the game</li>
</ul>


App was built for Windows/Linux/PC
